Ok, let me show the problem first.
We zoom in the drr image and make it out of the window, then pan the image from right to left or bottom to top, we can see the drr image has been truncated. There is another way to reproduce this problem,
first, pan the image to the top of the window, then zoom in the drr image.
I believe this problem caused by RadiographSampler, because the image raw buffer generated by sampler is truncated.
